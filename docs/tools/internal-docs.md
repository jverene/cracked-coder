# Internal documentation tool (`get_internal_docs`)

The `get_internal_docs` tool lets Cracked Coder access its own technical
documentation to provide more accurate answers about its capabilities and usage.

## Description

This tool is used when Cracked Coder needs to verify specific details about Gemini
CLI's internal features, built-in commands, or configuration options. It
provides direct access to the Markdown files in the `docs/` directory.

### Arguments

`get_internal_docs` takes one optional argument:

- `path` (string, optional): The relative path to a specific documentation file
  (for example, `reference/commands.md`). If omitted, the tool returns a list of
  all available documentation paths.

## Usage

The `get_internal_docs` tool is used exclusively by Cracked Coder. You cannot
invoke this tool manually.

When Cracked Coder uses this tool, it retrieves the content of the requested
documentation file and processes it to answer your question. This ensures that
the information provided by the AI is grounded in the latest project
documentation.

## Behavior

Cracked Coder uses this tool to ensure technical accuracy:

- **Capability discovery:** If Cracked Coder is unsure how a feature works, it can
  lookup the corresponding documentation.
- **Reference lookup:** Cracked Coder can verify slash command sub-commands or
  specific setting names.
- **Self-correction:** Cracked Coder can use the documentation to correct its
  understanding of Cracked Coder's system logic.

## Next steps

- Explore the [Command reference](../reference/commands.md) for a detailed guide
  to slash commands.
- See the [Configuration guide](../reference/configuration.md) for settings
  reference.
